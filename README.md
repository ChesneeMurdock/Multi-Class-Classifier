# Multi-Class-Classifier

Using a Deep Learning model (Neural Network) to perform multi-class text classification on a large dataset (IMDB dataset with code to download the Stack Overflow dataset)

A multi-class classifier in machine learning is a model that is designed to categorize input data into one of three or more possible classes; multi-class classification assigns each instance to one of several possible labels.

There are several common approaches to Multi-Class Classification. I will focus on Neural Networks (Deep Learning).

In this exercise, my deep learning model is a multi-class classifier because:

It categorized text data inputs into one of four distinct classes.

It uses Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, the appropriate loss function for multi-class classification.

It likely has a softmax activation at the output layer, which ensures that predictions sum to 1.

The dataset is structured for multi-class learning rather than binary classification.
